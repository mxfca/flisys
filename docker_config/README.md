# FliSys Docker Container

In this section you will find all resources required to run FliSys in a Docker Container. You can use these containers for testing in your own machine (or notebook), proof of concepts or even put it in production in a dedicated server.

> IMPORTANT: if you do not have a dedicated server or already have a web server (shared hosting), you does not need nothing from this section.
