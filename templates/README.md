## Class Template

**Filename**: template_class.php

**Destination Path**: /src/include

This file is used as template for new classes, just copy it to destination path renaming as **inc_<class_name>.php**.

A class should have all related tasks about the objective. For example, if you want to create a class that handle exportation files, start naming it as inc_export.php. Inside the file, after you declare the class export, you should cover all methods related to exportation files, such as: export a desired table as csv or as openFileDocument.

**DO NOT FORGET** that each method in a class should be specialist, that is, you need to break up your code in many pieces, where each method just do only one thing.
